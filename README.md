# serverless-aws-terraform-entwine-api
This repository hosts the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and application code for a serverless API that leverages AWS, Terraform, and Entwine. The API allows users to submit a GeoJSON polygon and, in return, receive a corresponding point cloud data subset from the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP).
